Derby and I checked out Dev Bootcamp's first NYC graduate presentations last week, and we were seriously impressed by the graduates, the teachers, the space, and the core philosophy. Wall Street had better ready itself for a transformation!

_Disclaimer: I'm hooked on the DBC Kool-Aid. I wasn't asked by anyone in the organization to write about their program—I'm driven by an internal desire to promote their awesomeness because people need to know about this._
  
A Bit'a Background
--------
[Dev Bootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com) was founded in San Francisco in early 2012 with the mission to enable people to "make beautiful and meaningful things" by teaching a practical, hands-on course in web development. The school has since moved eastward to NYC, setting up camp in Chicago along the way. Surprisingly, the core of DBC's curriculum isn't just about imparting technical ability, but also philosophy—an understanding of the self, the other, and the world that we all share. Though technical knowledge is taught from Day 1 [and, in fact, earlier, through a [remote prep course](http://devbootcamp.com/2014/05/08/why-phase-0-is-key-to-your-success-at-dev-bootcamp/?utm_content=buffera2e63&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)], DBC also has major focuses on self-awareness and empathy, extending as far as mandatory yoga for the first three weeks. From a [blog post](http://devbootcamp.com/2013/01/30/yoga-panic-pandas-3-things-you-might-not-expect-from-a-programming-bootcamp/) on the subject:  
  
>[Yoga] is a reminder for people to be mindful. It is a reminder that their body isn't just a vessel for their brains. It is a reminder, more than anything, that the point of acquiring these new skills isn't just to get a new job but to build a new, complete life.
  
Dev Bootcamp isn't just about teaching people how to create with technology. It's a platform for personal and, more importantly, interpersonal development to help shape our society into one that understands its people, its technologies, and the intimate connections between the two.  
  
How The Hackerati Got Involved
--------
Derby and I met DBC NYC Director Lloyd Nimetz for lunch several weeks ago after being introduced by a mutual contact, and I was blown away when he filled us in on their philosophical approach. It was obvious to me that this is the future of teaching programming—and _everything_.  
  
One of the issues I had with my own education—from K–12 through my undergraduate engineering program—was that it was mostly information-based. But there are universal principles of life that enable us to see connections between diverse fields of knowledge, and to ultimately connect this knowledge to ourselves.   
  
It's one thing to say, "This is a tool, this is how it works, this is how you use it." It's infinitely more comprehensible and powerful to say, "_You_ are a tool and this is how _you_ work. _That_ is a tool that you don't yet have and this is how _it_ works. Finally, this is how _your_ unique toolkit can best interface with _that_ tool." That last bit of understanding must ultimately take place within the individual, and a strong philosophical foundation is the most effective catalyst.  
  
A tool is useless without an informed operator, and is potentially dangerous without an understanding of its relation to society. DBC's acknowledgement of this idea allows them to stand out from other _learn to code quickly_ courses/bootcamps. They're the real deal, and I was stoked to get involved. Attending their first NYC presentation was a great way to get started.
  
The Presentations
--------
DBC NYC's premier cohort, the Fiddler Crabs [each cohort is named after an animal], graduated and presented their final projects on Friday, May 30th. The class of 12 was broken into three groups, each of which had their own impressive project to demonstrate:

###[The Delta](http://thedelta.herokuapp.com)
Know a programming language? Want to learn another? The Delta links common concepts between different languages by translating the language you know to the ones you desire to learn right before your eyes.

###[Encore](http://www.encoreapp.io)
Encore allows you to "relive your favorite concerts" by automatically aggregating information and media associated with concerts. So if you want to remember what song your favorite band played to kick off the second set, or simply want to check out a show from another seat in the venue, you can do so with Encore.

###[Tattle](http://whoownswhat.herokuapp.com)
Tattle enables users to discover where their products are actually coming from by identifying whether brands have parent companies, and by surfacing any controversies associated with them to help you make more informed decisions as a consumer.

Reflections
--------
All of the graduates spoke confidently and articulately about their work—a clear indicator that they gained a cohesive skillset throughout the rigorous nine-week course. It was most encouraging to see that they all set out to solve real problems that they've encountered directly. Equipped with new skills and _serious_ dedication to the craft, they built tools to solve them.

After the presentations, Derby and I were invited to eat and chat with the graduates. It was great to be able to get to know more about their backgrounds and their unique journeys to and through the bootcamp. It was also a lot of fun to introduce them to Google Glass, which has become quite a common ritual when interacting with thew groups.

Regardless of their former backgrounds, these DBC grads are now self- and socially-aware technological builders, and I'm comforted by the knowledge that people of this caliber have their hands and heads in the global machine. I'm further comforted by the fact that this is merely the beginning of DBC's residency in NYC—that they'll continue to train and deploy creative hackers driven by a desire to improve our shared world.
  
Looking Forward
--------
Widespread technological ability is one of the brightest aspects of our future. In this increasingly digital age, the ability to improve an existing framework from your home or mobile device is incredibly powerful. This is the literacy of a new generation, and DBC is paving the path forward with social and technological awareness.

With numerous bootcamps in existence in NYC alone—and more popping up every month—one should take DBC as the standard for an expertly-curated, comprehensive curriculum that understands contemporary sapiens and the tools they've built to manipulate information. In the [likely apocryphal, though sentimentally accurate] words of Albert Einstein, "It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity." Dev Bootcamp is doing its part to ensure that our humanity progresses alongside our ability to craft powerful new tools.

The next generation of creators is here. Get ready to ascend the exponential!
