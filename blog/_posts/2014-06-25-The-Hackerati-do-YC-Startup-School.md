Last week a few members of The Hackerati attended Y Combinator Startup School at the Best Buy Theater in Times Square, NYC. The event is an expo of Y Combinator companies, venture capitalist presenters, and their success stories and advice. Over 1000 people made their way out to what is usually a concert hall to listen to the likes of Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures and rising YC companies such as Instacart. If you’d like to watch the livestream recording you can find it [here](http://new.livestream.com/mbp/events/3083143/videos/54246958), with a segmented youtube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ-uHSnFig5NCQkhJfkn8ogXFwzrP4SIf "Youtube Videos of Event").

## What Happened

Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit, kicked off the event with a bit of history on YC Startup School. Startup School started as a small meeting between founders to share ideas and learn from each other how to be successful in building a technology company. “It’s important for people to come out to Startup School to be around people who are doing things.” He told all the people who just talk about doing something innovative and new to “stay home.” And he reminded us that it’s easy to get started: “You don’t have to open a factory—you just have to open a laptop.”

Ohanian is a dynamic moderator with a relaxed stage presence and serious charisma. He appealed to the rising tech community in New York by polling the audience to find out how far they’d come and from what boroughs/cities/states. The largest (read: loudest) contingencies of attendees were from Queens and Brooklyn, where the New York Tech community has an increasing presence. I personally came across founders from the likes of Philadelphia and Boston, and as far away as Missouri.

The first speaker of the series was one of the most topically interesting. Each speaker shared the things that they had learned during their experience working in startups, but Shana Fisher from Highline VP addressed her talk to opinions that are the opposite advice of what you usually hear. The following list summarizes the thought-provoking takeaways.

<h3 id="Shana">Shana Fisher — Unconventional Opinions for Startups</h3>

a) Runway: Don’t think about the time that your money gives you (i.e. your “runway”). Instead, make it last as long as you can; **bootstrap and be creative to get things like free space, free food, and free employment**.

b) Founders: Common knowledge says that you need multiple cofounders to be successful. Shana believes that **single founders can be just as successful** when their personality dictates and has invested in many single founders.

c) Time to Launch: **Launching quickly with plans to improve a half-baked product is no longer the path to success.** One needs to perfect products before release to general public because the marketplace is too crowded and noisy for a bad product to gain traction.

d) Location: **New York is good for early-stage startups, though they need roots in SF community. San Francisco still has better infrastructure for middle-stage startups.**

e) Investors: William Goldman once said “Nobody knows anything.” **Don’t always trust investors when they tell you something about your business.** Sometimes investors have too many deals going on and aren’t in the headspace to properly evaluate your deal. Shana followed up with, “I don’t believe in patterns,” and many investors are used to using patterns to make judgements about businesses. Each case needs to be evaluated individually as well.

f) Product Development: **Plan for today and don’t always think too much about scaling in the future.** Your focus as a business is to build a product your users can pay you for or make use of TODAY. Additionally, product design is plateauing as investors see flat, simple design as the only option for good design. You should think about design breakthroughs. Copying Apple and other top products raises the risk of getting lost in the crowd.

g) People: **People are the most important asset for every company so take care to be a good manager.** Many entrepreneurs have little management experience and should learn one by one as they hire employees. Don’t hire a new employee until you’ve learned how to manage the last employee. Also, hire different perspectives: men, women, people from New York and people from abroad. Don’t forget to be mindful of “can I talk to you for a minute” conversations. Take care of what your employees need and don’t hire unless you understand or have the ability to manage each employee. Otherwise things will go wrong.

h) Equinox: There is a line between when you *don’t* have to make money and when you *do* called the equinox. **Think about your business model and understand when you’re past the equinox** and NEED to make money before things begin to unravel.

i) Cosmos: **Dream of building something that can reach the end of the universe.** Grand ideas for changing the world are what make startups great and lead to success when executed with passion and vision. 

Shana Fisher spoke very conversationally and stressed that these are just her opinions based on her experience funding startups. Her presentation was particularly well designed by an artist, with each slide containing the topic word or phrase and a beautiful graphic. 

She also chided the audience to not write about what she said.

Whoops.

<h3 id="Fred">Fred Wilson — Attitudes Towards Investing</h3>

Next to the stage was the eminent VC Fred Wilson, revered Union Square Ventures investor. The format of his presentation was an interview with one of the YC partners. They lounged in comfy chairs and went back and forth discussing the status of New York entrepreneurship and his beliefs on what makes a successful startup. 

Fred opened up about what he looks for when evaluating a pitch. **“It’s important for investors to have conviction.”** They need to come to a meeting ready to evaluate the pitch with an open mind. However, he admitted that he often enters meetings with preconceived notions about what is interesting to him. Fred recalled discussing a “google for jobs” idea with a colleague several years back, wherein one could just search for the job they wanted and receive accurate listings. When the founders of indeed.com crossed his desk, he jumped at the opportunity because *this was that thing he’d been talking about!*

One of the highlights of the back and forth was when the YC Partner casually mentioned how Fred passed up the opportunity to invest in Airbnb. Fred pointed at his back and responded with “I’ve got an open wound right here, you want to pour more salt in it?” He also discussed another failed investment—Turntable.fm—where he invested because he knew the entrepreneurs well. There was a lot of churn in the business, but Fred admitted that he overlooked some metrics because of how hot the growth was and how much he admired the team. You need to bet on the entrepreneur.

Fred then described the flight of stairs that it takes to build a business, which you can find in detail on his [blog](http://avc.com/2014/06/what-seed-financing-is-for/ "Fred Wilson Blogpost"). He said that many of the entrepreneurs he meets start off strong but, after making the initial round of funding, don’t put their heads down and build a business. An entrepreneur needs to be an expert watchdog for every aspect of his business—accounting, operations, fundraising, product development, marketing—or needs to be willing to find the right people to fill each need.

In his final comment, Fred discussed the geography question that Shana had touched on in her presentation. SaaS and consumer businesses are both thriving in NYC and one big advantage is that there is SO MUCH CAPITAL. It's a seller’s market for entrepreneurs and a great time to start a company. Fred closed by discussing the tech scenes around the world, including Israel, which he said has a 30+ year-old startup scene that is stronger than ever. Israel has always been a powerhouse for startups (see: [Start-up Nation](http://www.amazon.com/Start-up-Nation-Israels-Economic-Miracle/dp/0446541478 "Startup Nation Amazon")the book.), and though in 2008 they took a bit longer than San Francisco and NYC to transition into the current model, they are now doing incredibly well. 

Fred’s talk was one of my favorites for the night because it included so many pieces of advice that were delivered concisely and with awesome anecdotes to back them up. 

<h3 id="Zach">Zach Sims — Codecademy</h3>

Zach Sims was probably the most relatable speaker of the night. As the cofounder
of Codecademy, he had an audience full of entrepreneurs and budding coders
gratefully and attentively hanging on to every word of his founding story. 

For those who aren’t aware, Codecademy is a web platform that teaches people to code in a number of programming languages through in-browser command line challenges. Zach’s story is a Y Combinator legend. A mere few weeks before demo day, he and his partner, Ryan Bubinski, weren’t even sure what company/product they were building. The YC partners and other advisors had all but given up hope and told them to make sure that whatever they presented should be embarrassing—but not *super* embarrassing.

After running through a number of crazy ideas, including a CRM for club promoters (which Zach fondly described as one of the worst ideas ever), they settled on a product that allowed Zach, the non-technical founder, to become a proficient programmer during his time at YC. Codecademy was released two weeks before demo day and instantly skyrocketed in the rankings as formerly frustrated programming students clamored to get more from the team. They were overjoyed to be able to finally learn to build something with code. The growth and turnaround surprised everyone, including Zach and Ryan.

Zach and Ryan were eventually funded for 2.5 million dollars by Union Square Ventures. One of my favorite moments was when Zach showed his ATM receipt after taking out $60 and the balance was around $2,499,940. Zach’s presentation was super down to earth and incorporated real-life pictures from his experience. This made his lessons all the more impactful. 

There were a number of lessons incorporated into the presentation, but the main idea Zach shared was simple and powerful: **Don’t make the mistake of building a product just to build a product.** Zach wanted to learn to code more easily, and he and Ryan built something for Zach to learn to code. **Build a product to solve one of your problems.**

Thank you, Zach and Ryan, from the tech community at large, for bringing programming to the world.

<h3 id="Kathryn">Kathryn Minshew — The Muse</h3>

Kathryn Minshew is the founder of the Muse, a career content site for professional women. This YC alum told her story and the lessons she learned from starting her business. To summarize her points:

1. Honor your word, not just your contracts
2. Done is better than perfect
3. Be insanely persistent and polite—don’t just ask once
4. Find people who share your values
5. Build velocity—don’t go for the big, one-time bump in numbers
6. Build an amazing team; go to bat for them whenever possible; figure out what motivates them
7. Don’t believe the hype—don’t look at all the successes in the media as the day to day—startups are hard work and thats just the highlight reel.

Kathryn gave her tips on hiring, including advice to hire from the “deadpool,” i.e. ex-employees of failed or failing startups. She talked about “lurking” on Hacker News and TechCrunch to see when companies have issues or are leaking employees. When Grooveshark was hit by a lawsuit, she stalked LinkedIn and job boards to see if anyone was looking for work. 

Kathryn talked very quickly but carried herself with poise. Her talk may have been riddled with expletives, but her frankness served to add to her honesty and credibility. 

<h3 id="Apoorva">Apoorva Mehta — Instacart</h3>

Instacart is an app for grocery shopping that delivers groceries to your door. You select the products you want from select grocery stores in your area, and a personal shopper purchases and delivers them within two hours. Instacart is a recent phenomenon that takes shopping for groceries to the Internet. 

Apoorva Mehta left his job at Amazon in Seattle for San Francisco to start a company. Along the way, he and his partner prototyped dozens of ideas before settling on solving a problem they faced—the horror of shopping for groceries. 

They eventually got into YC and worked to build their user base by having everyone at YC use their service. Apoorva recounted a number of amusing stories, including the time when YC used his service to order 200 bottles of soda; his shopper was unable to make the delivery herself and called him crying. He personally went over to help her load the bottles into her car to make a delivery. Upon delivery, he received a grateful reply from Renee, the dinner coordinator: “This was so convenient, I’m going to do this every week!” There's great irony in Apoorva solving the problem of grocery shopping by buying extreme amounts of groceries.

Lessons: 
a) **Keep trying until you find the right idea; solve a problem that matters to you**
b) **Worry about scalability later; bootstrap your ideas and solve problems with what you have until you require something better**

<h3 id="David">David Lee - SV Angel</h3>

David Lee is an accomplished investing partner at SV Angel. His talk centered on lessons he learned from Ron Conway, who has over 20 years of experience investing in startups. 

He opened with the story of personal inspiration: His father invented a device that automated the manufacture of fortune cookies, and so lived the life of a startup founder, with all of the ups and downs associated with a running one’s own business. His slide deck came straight from a document that SV Angel uses to guide its decision making process to invest in companies.

![Fortune Cookie Slide](/blog/assets/img/FortuneCookie.jpg)

The driving force behind an investment decision is “chemistry with founders.” If they like the founder and they like the industry, they're likely to invest. A good founder has:

1) **“A good elevator pitch. Keep it simple.”** 
David’s opinion is that the single most important skill a founder can have is the ability to express their vision to customers, employees, and investors.

2) **“Good listeners. Strong willed but flexible.”** 
A founder should be able to listen to all advice/data, process it, and make the right decision. A founder needs to be flexible but also able to ignore the wrong advice.

3) **A focus on “Value Add”** 
He doesn’t look at an investor just based on price but also based on what the investor can offer.

4) **“Never forget, your reputation is your biggest asset.”** 
David advises building a strong reputation for things like:

- quick responsiveness 
- leading by example 24/7 without distraction 
- over-communicating with the team, customers, and investors 
- having a clear vision 
- moving quickly: don’t sweat logistics, devil's in the details.

Very important advice for founders to keep in mind.

<h3 id="Chase">Chase Adam — Watsi: A nonprofit YC venture</h3>

The closing act of the event was an inspirational talk by Chase Adam about founding Watsi: a crowdfunding platform that raises money to cover medical bills for people in impoverished nations without healthcare.

Chase described his experience as the first YC nonprofit. His founding experience was born when returning to San Francisco after a couple of years in the Peace Corps. While he expected his friends back home to be relatively miserable in their nine-to-fives, he instead returned to find that they were thriving at startups, innovating to change the world.

Chase was inspired to found his company and convinced his team to work as volunteers to build the initial site. He described the difficulties in finding a developer to build the product and also described the incredible effort that went into generating votes for a HuffPost-sponsored startup competition. He swore that he would never do an online voting competition again because it was “one of the most stressful weeks of \[his\] life.” To take the lead in the competition, one of his employees convinced a bouncer to make people vote before entering the bar. Awesome creativity and drive.

Some important lessons for startups he shared included:

- **“The only thing separating us from success is working hard and not giving up.”** 
- Don’t overgrow. **“Embrace the challenge and the awkwardness of not hiring.”** 

Chase was an inspirational closing act because he showed how radical startups can drastically improve social welfare.

### Closing Thoughts

People stayed well past 10:00PM to talk startups and embody the philosophy of the event. They shared the experience and dream of DOING, innovating, and creating positive change through technology. I highly recommend Startup School to anyone who feels they gained insight from this article.
