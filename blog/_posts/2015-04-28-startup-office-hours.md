[Startup Office Hours](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Office-Hours-NYC/) is The Hackerati's way of promoting the early-stage startup world and sharing experiences to help founders along in their journeys. The Hackerati has entrepreneurship at its core: our founders Geoff Scott and Rob Marano have been involved in a total of eight startups, and our nascent Hackerati Labs incubator seeks to fund startups conceived by the entrepreneurial engineers on our team. It became obvious that we should be directly involved with this growing community of risk-takers with transformative ideas, and so Startup Office Hours was born.

What began as a group of about 25 people in a classroom at NYIT has grown to over 1200 members with events being held at various startup spaces around New York—and even once at Viacom. It's been awesome to watch this community grow and to garner feedback from people across the entrepreneurial spectrum, from the early-stage founders still figuring out their ideas to the seasoned veterans and VCs. Our goal from the beginning was to keep things casual while still offering valuable advice and sparking meaningful discussions. We believe we've succeeded, and we thankfully applaud our members—whether they've come just once or every month—and all of our impressive presenters. Here's to the continued success of another dedicated NYC community!

Here are a few highlights from past events:<br><br>
[John Pavley](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Office-Hours-NYC/events/219878876/)<br>
We met at a gorgeous Viacom event space, where John Pavley shared his experience from working with Apple, DoubleClick, Yahoo!, LimeWire, Spotify, Huffington Post, and currently Viacom as SVP Engineering. Pavley is also an Adjunct Instructor at NYU. Check out his brilliant talk on [Taboo-Driven Innovation](http://jpavley.github.io/).<br>

[OpenBCI](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Office-Hours-NYC/events/180105552/)<br>
An artist and self-taught Electrical Engineer taught a class at Parsons, where one of his students built a brain-monitoring baseball hat. They broke off to fund OpenBCI [BCI = Brain Computer Interface] via Kickstarter and raised $215,000 in their quest for $100k. This was an awesome talk with an even cooler demo!<br>

[Schoology](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Office-Hours-NYC/events/214988082/)<br>
This onsite event—i.e. one where Schoology both hosted and presented—was incredibly insightful, as Schoology has done an incredible job scaling a project that began in a college course to support over 7 million users in all 50 states and more than 150 countries.<br>

[Casting to the People](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Office-Hours-NYC/events/220682803/)<br>
We gathered again in the gorgeous loft on Bowery that [Casting to the People](http://www.c2thep.com/) uses as their office—this time to hear about _their_ startup: a mobile auditioning app that lets applicants vote up top submissions, allowing the most talented actors to be discovered—regardless of their connections.<br>
