The Hackerati recently submitted a proposal for an interactive museum project. To augment our written proposal, our videographer-in-residence, Alex Sheehan, put together this highlight reel to demonstrate The Hackerati's UI/UX abilities and prior work with museums.

The [Highlight Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xR6bkN5RPw) shows the following work:


__Alex Sheehan__  

- _Bugs_ on [Alex's personal website](http://www.amsheehan.com)
- Clips from two videos Alex directed/shot/edited
  - A dance video
  - The [Google Glass video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf6JSzoGTag) referenced in [my last post]({{ site.url }}/blog/2014/05/06/the-hackerati-at-the-un.html) about our work with the United Nations


__Eddy Garcia__  

- A Kinect-driven motion capture server which connects to user's smartphones, providing activity feedback. The smartphone then plays a customized playlist for users based on accelerometer, location, and activity data. An example use case would be a playlist generator used while exercising.
- A pseudo-3D video game made in hardware (VHDL on an FPGA) with an embedded
   processor. The project implemented a customized VHDL raycasting module which was used to accelerate 3D graphics.


__Geoff Scott__  

- Created software for immersive video exhibits at the National Prisoner-of-War museum in Andersonville, Georgia


__Rob Marano__  

- Technology Director for the September 11th Photo Project

Enjoy and prepare for more videos and more highlights as The Hackerati continues to be fearless about creating awesomeness!
