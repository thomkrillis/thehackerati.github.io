The Hackerati continues to build out its leadership team with industry veterans, proudly adding Amanda Keleher as Chief People Officer. She’s extremely seasoned, having held multiple senior People roles at IT consulting companies, including Global Head of People at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/). She then relocated to New York to join [Intent Media](http://intentmedia.com/) as VP of People. 

As a _people company_, The Hackerati relies heavily on social contracts and nontraditional approaches to foster an enjoyable, creative, innovative culture. Our culture has been focused on transparency, authenticity, and having a helluva lot of fun from Day One.

As Chief People Officer, Amanda will lead and continue to develop our unique culture, with a focus on diversity and innovation. She’s also working on some exciting initiatives to collaborate with other NYC Tech companies and the tech community in general.

The Hackerati attracts and retains top engineers by offering a work environment that doesn’t really feel like work. With a blossoming startup accelerator [Hackerati Labs] as our core side project, there’s plenty of room for personal and team growth. And at the absolute forefront of everything we do is the motto _Be Fearless_.

We understand that innovation isn’t a product of following the crowd, and we do our best to promote and celebrate differences. Catering to all of our team’s diverse interests—from hacking to music to breakdancing to learning languages to poetry—is a core internal focus, and this is why having Amanda Keleher on board as Chief People Officer is a huge step forward for us.

Though early in her journey as a Hackerata, Amanda has already provided a powerful burst of perspective and energy. We all feel fortunate to work with such a force, and are sure to look back on this event and see it as an overwhelmingly positive turning point.

Welcome aboard, Amanda. Onward and upward!
