Back at the UN
--------
The Hackerati was invited back to the United Nations for another presentation to promote 	_Humanicy: The Human Side of Diplomacy_. Check out my [post]({{ site.url }}/blog/2014/05/06/the-hackerati-at-the-un.html) on Humanicy's April 4th media launch event for details on the platform.

December 4th and 5th marked the first full-fledged Humanicy event: a two-day celebration of art and its ability to help us recognize that we are all human beings connected through love and expression. [Ambassador Toriello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Antonio_Toriello) has promoted this idea at the UN because of inherent diplomatic and political buffers between this core human instinct to express and love. As I wrote in my other post, "[Toriello] sees art as the foundation of the human experience, and believes that diplomats and politicians who see each other as fellow human beings _before_ discussing politics are more likely to establish meaningful connections."

Once again, a question may be quite appropriately raised: how does this involve The Hackerati?

Art is Science | Science is Art
--------

The two-day Humanicy event featured discussions, presentations, and performances highlghting the importance of art, including musicians—like Peter Yarrow from _Peter, Paul, and Mary_ and a Juilliard/Columbia string ensemble—a cartoonist, photographers, painters, a documentarian...the list goes on. Yet there was no focus on the technology driving each of these art forms—at least not until our presentation.

As Creative Technologists—professional engineers who weave their artistic pursuits into their work—The Hackerati teamed up with a few members of [Local Projects](http://localprojects.net/) to illuminate the age-old confluence of science and art. In fact, the word technology comes from two Greek roots: _techne_, meaning art or craft, and _logia_, meaning science or study. Everything is technology; everything is a blend of science and art.

I did my best to convey this sentiment in my introduction through my primary method of expression: spoken word. 

Grace followed with insight into technology's influence on heightened empathy. Using open-source facial recognition software, she suggested we would better understand others if we could see oursleves _as_ them.

She took on the face of the Mona Lisa,

the Dalai Lama,

and even Ambassador Toriello!

Andreas Borg of Local Projects rounded off by using the same software to highlight this empathic response on a global political level, translating facial expressions into sound and asking us to perceive ostensibly cacophonous interactions as orchestrated music.

The Hackerati Band's Official Debut
--------
![Alt text]({{ site.url }}/blog/assets/img/humanicy_7.png "Humanicy7")
To further emphasize the inseparability of science and art, The Hackerati Band—which first came together at our Holiday Party last year—played its first official set the night before, following the Juilliard/Columbia string ensemble. The band consisted of Derby [Vocals and Percussion], Grace Avery [Piano], and Omar Niazi [Trumpet] of The Hackerati, Andreas Borg [Guitar] of Local Projects, and supporting musicians Karen Larson [Violin], Jose Moura [Bass Guitar], and Sebastian Guerrero [Cajón].

While this portion of the Thursday event isn't on UN Web TV, we've posted two songs on our Youtube Channel. [_Mi Vida_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB-YobsQUs4) was written by Derby and Andreas, and the unofficially titled [_Grace's Song_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmILxwIa5sE) was written by Derby and Grace.

Thank You!

We'd like to once again thank Ambassador Toriello and the [Friendship Ambassadors Foundation](http://www.faf.org/main/) for hosting Humanicy and inviting us along to share our perspective. Though The Hackerati is an engineering startup, we celebrate our team's ability to use these tools to better express ourselves and look forward with great anticipation to further highlight the eternal bond between knowledge and expression.
