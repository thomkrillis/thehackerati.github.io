We've discussed internally the possibility of sharing more personal art on this blog, à la Grace's _[Cosmospolitan](http://www.thehackerati.com/blog/2014/04/28/cosmospolitan.html)_ and [awesome comic](http://www.thehackerati.com/blog/2014/05/20/hackerati-comics.html). 

The immense sadness surrounding Robin Williams' death has been overwhelmingly present in my mind, so I've decided to share a poem I wrote after hearing the news last night:
<br><br>

Aladdin rubbed that magic lamp<br>
and a gleeful genie emerged to affirm<br>
that we ain't never had a friend like Robin Williams

wasn't long before I was hooked<br>
on his ability to inspire<br>
a tireless stream of happy thoughts<br>
that made flying as easy as realizing<br>
that we _all_ have magic inside of us<br>
BANGARANG!<br>

then Jumanji got me wandering<br>
through the mystical lands of imagination<br>
dangerous, yes<br>
but riddled with unlimited possibilities<br>
just roll the dice<br>
and hope you'll hit the finish line<br>
no turning back now<br>

I was Jacked up<br>
growing<br>
but forever young<br>

and wondering<br>
what dreams may come<br>
when the end is reached<br>
does one perish only to be revived?<br>

like dead poets brought alive<br>
by John Keating<br>
insisting that we seize the day<br>
and pray to the lords of language<br>
so we too may learn to contribute a verse<br>
and see the world as it is<br>
an endless ocean of emotion<br>
in constant flux between pain and beauty<br>
O Captain, My Captain!<br>

you man a rowboat solo<br>
navigating more serious waters now<br>
effusing good will by<br>
hunting for the means to communicate<br>
to an immature genius<br>
that life is less about knowing<br>
than experiencing<br>
and feeling<br>

goooooood<br> 
_morning_ Vietnaaaaam!<br>
wake up and smell the napalm

though I doubt fire ever burned hotter<br>
than in Robin's heart<br>
so heated that it sparked through his chest<br>
and spread to his synthetic breasts<br>
when he surrendered his manhood<br>
for man's good<br>
because everyone needs a good laugh

and...that's what makes it so tragic

that the magic behind those laughs<br>
was slowly killing the clown<br>

that one who inspired so much joy<br>
could not escape the darkness<br>
of feeling so helplessly alone<br>

this is a testament<br>
to the importance<br>
of looking beyond someone's outward disposition<br>
of peering past the carefully constructed façade<br>
and nourishing the inner light<br>
before the flame loses life<br>
and suffocates in shadow<br>

You will be missed, Robin Williams. <br>
Thank you for sharing your light while you had it.
