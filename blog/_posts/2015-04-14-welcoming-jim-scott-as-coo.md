The Hackerati is proud to announce Jim Scott as Chief Operating Officer. Jim has been in the industry for over 20 yearsâ€”a seasoned executive with both Fortune 100 and startup experience. His expertise in corporate and business development, marketing, product development, and financial management with a deep information technology background leave him perfectly equipped to help grow this entrepreneurial engineering team. We're ecstatic to have such a competent leader join our team.
 
Prior to joining The Hackerati, Jim was the President of SimplyEngage, a SaaS company focused on providing multi-unit brands with the tools and and data insight to engage customers locally. Prior to SimplyEngage, Jim was the Chief Operating Officer of PerformLine (an affiliate marketing and services firm), Automated Resources Group (a marketing services firm focusing on subscriber membership and audience management) and Donnelley Marketing (an infoGroup company) where he was responsible for operating income objectives as well as all aspects of solution delivery services, account management services, data processing services, vendor management, and production services. Prior to Donnelley Marketing, Jim was the Founder and CEO of ResponseLogic, a personalization software and services firm enabling marketers to target web and email content based on a proprietary recommendation engine.

Bringing on Jim as COO is a big step forward in scaling The Hackerati. We've been around for almost three years, and most of our growth has been on the engineering side. Jim's expertise in direct marketing will be pivotal in further expanding our clientele, which will in turn allow us to continue hiring brilliant, creative engineers.

I've had the pleasure of working closely with Jim since he began and he's been tremendously helpful in providing a structured approach to marketing. He's also helping push Labs forward on the organizational side, including an overview on what it takes to raise capital at our March Pitch Day.

This is just the beginning of The Hackerati's internal growth. I've been here since January 2013 when the team was about six months old and it's been awesome to track our progress. There ain't nothin' as exciting as building out a startup!
